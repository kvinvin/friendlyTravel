This is the beginning of the friendlyTravel app! 

If you are a globetrotter and meet people around the world, then this app is just for you. 

Add people you meet while traveling to always know where they are. This is not meant in the creepy "I know which street you are walking up right now" way, but in the way that you can share your location at a certain gradient level: "Country, State, 50km radius, City, Exact".

When you travel onwards, you can always check out the app and see if your path crosses with someone you have met before, allowing you to make plans and meet up again!


Technicalities: 
    - Location update happens 1x a day, at around 8AM, and while opening the app.
